# 🐾 Paw-sition Paper: The Matilda Meme Coin Dashboard  
### Authored by Baka the Cat (Dictator of wuwei's Household)

## 1. Executive Summewwy

*"I, Baka, have reviewed my human’s crypto endeavors and found them lacking in both grace and fur. The Qubic memecoin scene is awakening, and it deserves a proper Matilda-approved dashboard-curated with care, humor, and actual data. As my human's overseer, I demand collaboration, not coinage."*

**Mission:**  
Create a Matilda-partnered dashboard and info hub that:

- Provides curated data on Qubic memecoins (starting with Matilda, naturally).
- Builds bridges between community members through transparent listings, contributor highlights, and future giveaways (pending collaboration).
- Prioritizes trust: surfaces helpful info for DYOR, with the occasional paw of approval for well-behaved coins. 🐾
- Offers support for newer users and projects navigating the emerging memecoin space.

**Budget:**  
No financial support required. However, we request:

- **Development feedback** (on layout, UX, features).
- **Help testing** the MVP.
- **Ongoing collaboration** with the Matilda team (and broader community) to ensure the site remains useful, fun, and purr-worthy.
- **Optional dev paw-ticipation** for curious cats 🧶 - anyone interested in learning the basics of Python, visualizations, or Streamlit is welcome to join the litter and build alongside us!

## 2. The Probemew (Problem, But With More Meow)

The Qubic memecoin ecosystem is in its kitten phase:

- Only two coins are currently tradeable: **CFB** and **MATILDA**.
- Two more, **QXMR** and **CODED**, are expected to airdrop within the next month.
- No existing site or dashboard summarizes this information or tracks emerging meme assets.
- Community members must hunt across social platforms for updates (very un-catlike behavior).

This is a missed opportunity to strengthen community trust, coordination, and visibility as the Qubic memecoin litter expands.

---

## 3. The Solumewtion (As Dictated by Baka)

The dashboard will include:

- 📊 **Live memecoin data** (prices, volume, socials, provenance, and notes from Baka-approved curators).
- 🐱 **"Cat-alysts"** - real-time alerts or updates for noteworthy price action or community events.
- 🧶 **Community spotlights** and verified contributor lists (aka “Top Kibble Earners”).
- 🛠️ **Curated listings** with focus on authenticity, intent, and memes-per-second (MPS).

Everything will be optimized for humans who serve cats-and memecoin fans alike.

---

## 4. Roadmap (a.k.a. My Nap Schedule)

**Phase 1: Proof-of-Catcept (Now)**  
- Initial Streamlit prototype is live and operational under feline surveillance.
- Manual listings for current memecoins (MATILDA, CFB) are in place.
- 🛠️ **Data collection methods** already developed:
  - **CEXes:**
    - **MEXC**: Price and market data for QUBIC pulled via the `ccxt` package.
    - **Safe.Trade**: Direct API integration for MATILDA and CFB (IP access approved by Safe.Trade Team - Baka sends purrs).
  - **DEX:**
    - **qx.qubic.org**: Custom scraper fetching data for MATILDA and CFB.
- This forms the foundation for more automated and reliable token metrics as the cat-alog expands.

**Phase 2: Scratching Post Upgrade (Q3/Q4 2025)**  
- Fully functional MVP with polished layout.
- Automatic or semi-automatic data fetching for token metrics.
- Pages per coin with descriptions, links, and community status.
- Add “Baka’s Corner”: curated alerts, commentary, and trading wisdoms like *"Only leap if the candle is green."*.

**Phase 3: Quantum Purr-suit (2026)**  
- Matilda & Baka partnership deepens.
- Baka begins learning coding (via excessive keyboard napping).
- Long-term collaboration with the Qubic ecosystem: contribute to **aigarth** development (AGI research project).

**Phase 4: Solar System Domination (TBD)**  
- *Aigarth* becomes **Catgarth**.  
- Matilda ascend to interplanetary meme-gods.
- Memecoin dashboards become galactic standard.

## 5. Budget (All Figures Paw-reviewed)

| **Item**                     | **Cost**       | **Justification (by Baka)**                              |
|------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| VPS Hosting                  | Donated        | Already covered by human intern (meow worthy).            |
| Design & Layout Help         | Needed         | Human has thumbs but no aesthetic sense.                  |
| Testing & Feedback           | Needed         | Critical to improve paws-on usability.                    |
| Collaboration (Matilda team) | Encouraged     | For insight, branding input, and mutual mischief.         |
| **Total**                    | **Zero Qu’s**  | Just support, advice, and occasional headpats.            |

> 💸 *Note:* A **Qubic wallet address may be provided** to collect optional donations. Any funds received will be transparently used for **community engagement purposes** (e.g., giveaways, bounties, or reward events).

## 6. Why Matilda? (By Order of Baka)

- You’re cats. We’re cats. This is fate.
- Matilda is more than a memecoin - she’s a movement (and a fellow feline).
- My human promises a *"Baka’s Pick"* badge for Matilda-related stats.
- I’ll allow a *"Approved by Matilda"* logo (if it’s shaped like a paw).
- As a proud **Matilda Intern**, my human is dedicated to prioritizing Matilda-related features, data, and pawsitive vibes.

---

## 7. Next Steps (Human Translation)

**Option 0:** Ignore Baka (not advised).  
**Option 1:** Collaborate with this fur-midable proposal and gain:

- 🐾 Eternal gratitude (Baka will permit minor belly rubs).
- 🎉 Community dashboard with tailored meme coin data.
- 🤝 Partnership that strengthens the Qubic meme-verse.
- 🧍‍♂️ My human’s labor (until I demand cuddles).

### Action Items:
- Send treats to wuwei to begin negotiations.
- My human will demo the prototype (if I allow them off lap duty).
- Feedback welcome on features, layout, and meme optimization.

## Closing Statement from Baka

*"This dashboard will be the cat’s pajamas of crypto tools. Approve it, or I’ll sit directly on your node logs."*

**🐾 Respectfully,**
